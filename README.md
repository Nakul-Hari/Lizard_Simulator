# Lizard_Simulator
This MATLAB script simulates the motion of a lizard using a simple graphical representation. The lizard can be moved using arrow keys, and different states of motion are depicted.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. **Running the Script**: Open the provided MATLAB script file (`lizard_motion_simulator.m`) in MATLAB.
3. **Executing the Simulation**: Run the script. You will see a graphical window displaying the lizard and its motion.
4. **Controlling the Lizard**:
   - Use the arrow keys to move the lizard in different directions.
   - Press `Q` to quit the simulation.

## Script Details

- The script defines functions to represent different states of the lizard's motion.
- It utilizes MATLAB's plotting capabilities to visualize the lizard and its movement.
- The lizard's body and legs change color periodically to provide a dynamic visual representation.

## Files

- `lizard_motion_simulator.m`: MATLAB script file containing the lizard motion simulation code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the script and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the .m files in Matlab
3. Play with the Lizard till you get bored...lol.
